# DragonBall Arena

DBA is a multiplayer fighting game on the universe of DragonBallZ.

I have created it entierly myself mostly from scratch.
I have used external sources for :
- Slick2D : basic java 2D rendering library
- Kryonet : java server library
- sprite sheets from internet
- musics from internet

- Multiplayer 1vs1 / 2vs2 fight is available. Actually no permanent online servers are available, so you will need to launch your own DBA server. You can download the server on my github: [DBAServer](https://github.com/Draym/DBAServer/releases/tag/V1.0.0). You can contact kevin.andres@epitech.eu for help.

Then it is needed to enter the serverIP in the 'BATTLE' screen.
